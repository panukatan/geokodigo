#' An Interface to the Philippine Standard Geographical Codes
#'
#' The Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC) is a classification and coding
#' of the geographical-political subdivisions of the country, such as the
#' region, the province, the municipality/city and the barangay. The PSGC is
#' currently compiled and updated quarterly through a collaborative effort of
#' the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) and its interagency Technical
#' Working Group on Geographic Code (TWGGC) composed of the Department of the
#' Interior and Local Government (DILG), Commission on Elections (COMELEC),
#' National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA), and the Land
#' Management Bureau (LMB). This package provides utilities for accessing
#' different versions of the PSGC over time, formatting and structuring them
#' into machine-readable relational database-ready formats.
