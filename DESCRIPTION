Description: The Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC) is a classification 
    and coding of the geographical-political subdivisions of the country, such 
    as the region, the province, the municipality/city and the barangay. The
    PSGC is currently compiled and updated quarterly through a collaborative 
    effort of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) and its interagency 
    Technical Working Group on Geographic Code (TWGGC) composed of the 
    Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), Commission on 
    Elections (COMELEC), National Mapping and Resource Information Authority 
    (NAMRIA), and the Land Management Bureau (LMB). This package provides
    utilities for accessing different versions of the PSGC over time,
    formatting and structuring them into machine-readable formats.
